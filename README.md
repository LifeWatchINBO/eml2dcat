# IPT-DCAT

## Rationale

This project aims to make the [GBIF Integrated Publish Toolkit (IPT)](https://github.org/ipt) compliant with the [Data Catalog Vocabulary application profile (DCAT-AP)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description), by exposing Catalog, Dataset, and Distribution information in the IPT. This repository defines the EML to DCAT-AP mapping and describes the functional requirements to implement it in the IPT.

## Resources

* [Fork of the IPT source code](https://github.com/oSoc15/ipt): this is where we'll implement the DCAT-AP functionality
* [DCAT to IPT mapping](mapping.md)
* [DCAT-AP model](http://dcat.be/images/dcat-ap.png): image of the DCAT-AP objects, properties and relationships.
* [DCAT-AP validator](https://validator.dcat-editor.com/): in Swedish, but should work for Belgian DCAT-AP too
