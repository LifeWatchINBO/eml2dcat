# IPT-DCAT

## Rationale

This project aims to make the [GBIF Integrated Publish Toolkit (IPT)](https://github.org/ipt) compliant with the [Data Catalog Vocabulary application profile (DCAT-AP)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description), by exposing Catalog, Dataset, and Distribution information in the IPT. This repository defines the EML to DCAT-AP mapping and describes the functional requirements to implement it in the IPT.
